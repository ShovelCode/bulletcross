e-series planets:
secular governments, variations on neoliberal economic systems, mostly well terraformed for food production
moons: on all planetary systems the moons do most of the manufacturing as the lower gravity requires less energy, portals from moons typically go straight to their parent
planet

building materials: due to larger energy conversion technologies, artifically crafted diamond, ruby, sapphire, and emeralds are all popular building materials. cut stones, 
almost no more wooden housing. 

roads and bridges: usually non existent as everything flies, where roads are today there is a plain of grass like a golf course

internet: with quantum entanglement modems near-instant transfer of information is possible across lightyears

dimension-hopping: done, with some settlements in other dimensions

no spaceships, only portals with differential coordinates for destinations. usually very well regulated and documented

religions: most people professing to believe in one god are Muslims, the majority actually being mystical schools of Shia Islam, not Sunni. Jews still around. Sikhism has
grown to eclipse Hinduism. Zoroastrianism much larger. The majority of those professing to be Christians are actually
unitarians, the LDS (Mormons) being the largest, followed by La Luz del Mundo, Iglesia Ni Cristo, and Jehovah's Witnesses.
