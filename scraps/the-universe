e-series planets:
secular governments, variations on neoliberal economic systems, mostly well terraformed for food production
moons: on all planetary systems the moons do most of the manufacturing as the lower gravity requires less energy, portals from moons typically go straight to their parent
planet

building materials: due to larger energy conversion technologies, artifically crafted diamond, ruby, sapphire, and emeralds are all popular building materials. cut stones, 
almost no more wooden housing. 

roads and bridges: usually non existent as everything flies, where roads are today there is a plain of grass like a golf course

internet: with quantum entanglement modems near-instant transfer of information is possible across lightyears

dimension-hopping: done, with some settlements in other dimensions

no spaceships, only portals with differential coordinates for destinations. usually very well regulated and documented
