Imre rode his horse down the side of his cabbage patch. It was a gambit, the planet E7 was not known for food production, but at least the land was cheap. "I should leave these with the robots to care for, while attending to some errands on other worlds." He rode his horse to the stable he rented it from.
"The horse was good ride, thank you." Imre spoke to the robot attendant, who thanked him and promptly brought the horse
back into the stable. 
Imre opened up the holographic projection system of a small disc shaped
device in his pocket called a foan. He used an app that collected all of 
the coupons of businesses and services from the digital ether called NutBust.
NutBust was named so because it was supposed to reference a squirrel 
collecting nuts for the winter. Using a collection of coupons was called
busting a nut. Imre used collected digital coupons to get a ride in 
a robot-driven car to a local bank.
Once there Imre stepped off of the hovering craft and negotiated with
more robotic tellers to talk to a real human loan officer.
