Imre rode his horse down the side of his cabbage patch. It was a gambit, the planet E7 was not known for food production, but at least the land was cheap. "I should leave these with the robots to care for, while attending to some errands on other worlds." He rode his horse to the stable he rented it from.
"The horse was good ride, thank you." Imre spoke to the robot attendent, who thanked him and promptly brought the horse
back into the stable.
